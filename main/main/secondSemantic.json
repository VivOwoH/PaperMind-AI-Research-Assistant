                "abstract": "Accurate quantification of metabolites in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is challenged by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), overlapping metabolites, and various artifacts. Particularly, unknown and unparameterized baseline effects obscure the quantification of low-concentration metabolites, limiting MRS reliability. This paper introduces wavelet analysis-based neural decomposition (WAND), a novel data-driven method designed to decompose MRS signals into their constituent components: metabolite-specific signals, baseline, and artifacts. WAND takes advantage of the enhanced separability of these components within the wavelet domain. The method employs a neural network, specifically a U-Net architecture, trained to predict masks for wavelet coefficients obtained through the continuous wavelet transform. These masks effectively isolate desired signal components in the wavelet domain, which are then inverse-transformed to obtain separated signals. Notably, an artifact mask is created by inverting the sum of all known signal masks, enabling WAND to capture and remove even unpredictable artifacts. The effectiveness of WAND in achieving accurate decomposition is demonstrated through numerical evaluations using simulated spectra. Furthermore, WAND's artifact removal capabilities significantly enhance the quantification accuracy of linear combination model fitting. The method's robustness is further validated using data from the 2016 MRS Fitting Challenge and in-vivo experiments.",

                "abstract": "Reproducible and accurate fitting of the magnetic resonance spectrum is critical for estimating metabolite concentrations. We have previously developed a fitting software called ProFit-1D which was shown to fit 9.4T semi-LASER data from the human brain with high accuracy and precision. In this study, we adapted ProFit-1D to fit J-difference edited spectra acquired at a clinical field strength of 3T and to assessed its performance in simulated and in vivo data. ProFit-1D was adapted to fit J-difference edited data with alterations to the fitting range to exclude the 1.3 ppm lipid resonance, starting T2 relaxation constants, initial fit parameters, and adaptive spectral baseline determination. The accuracy of ProFit-1D was systematically evaluated on simulated GABA-edited and 2-hydroxyglutarate-edited (2HG-edited) data with different types of in vivo parameter variations and compared to that of LCModel and Gannet, two software commonly used to fit J-difference edited data. The precision of ProFit-1D was also evaluated in GABA-edited spectra acquired in vivo in the occipital cortex (OCC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of healthy participants at 3T using subsets of averages and compared to that of LCModel and Gannet. The 2HG fit error was also evaluated for ProFit-1D in 2HG-edited spectra acquired in glioma patients and compared to that of LCModel. Overall, it was found that ProFit-1D generally produced fits with low parameter fit errors across a variety of parameter variations. GABA, glutamate plus glutamine (Glx), and 2HG levels were also more accurately estimated with ProFit-1D than with LCModel and Gannet across different spectral disturbances and simulated concentrations. ProFit-1D was found to be as precise as LCModel and more precise than Gannet in estimating GABA and Glx. 2HG fit errors were 45% lower with ProFit-1D than with LCModel. Thus, ProFit-1D was found to produce high-quality fits to J- difference edited data with high accuracy and precision.",

                "abstract": "Purpose. Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (1H-MRSI) provides non-invasive spectral-spatial mapping of metabolism. However, long-standing problems in whole-brain 1H-MRSI are spectral overlap of metabolite peaks with large lipid signal from scalp, and overwhelming water signal that distorts spectra. Fast and effective methods are needed for high-resolution 1H-MRSI to accurately remove lipid and water signals while preserving the metabolite signal. The potential of supervised neural networks for this task remains unexplored, despite their success for other MRSI processing. Methods. We introduce a deep-learning method based on a modified Y-NET network for water and lipid removal in whole-brain 1H-MRSI. The WALINET (WAter and LIpid neural NETwork) was compared to conventional methods such as the state-of-the-art lipid L2 regularization and Hankel-Lanczos singular value decomposition (HLSVD) water suppression. Methods were evaluated on simulated and in-vivo whole-brain MRSI using NMRSE, SNR, CRLB, and FWHM metrics. Results. WALINET is significantly faster and needs 8s for high-resolution whole-brain MRSI, compared to 42 minutes for conventional HLSVD+L2. Quantitative analysis shows WALINET has better performance than HLSVD+L2: 1) more lipid removal with 41% lower NRMSE, 2) better metabolite signal preservation with 71% lower NRMSE in simulated data, 155% higher SNR and 50% lower CRLB in in-vivo data. Metabolic maps obtained by WALINET in healthy subjects and patients show better gray/white-matter contrast with more visible structural details. Conclusions. WALINET has superior performance for nuisance signal removal and metabolite quantification on whole-brain 1H-MRSI compared to conventional state-of-the-art techniques. This represents a new application of deep-learning for MRSI processing, with potential for automated high-throughput workflow.",

                "abstract": "Purpose While two-dimensional (2D) in vivo spectroscopy yields rich information and has been successfully used in clinical trials, it requires a localization scheme that minimizes the impact of chemical shift displacement on J-coupling evolution, a robust frequency drift correction and dedicated processing and quantification methods. Considering these needs this study demonstrates a novel data acquisition and an analysis pipeline to quantify 16 metabolites in mmol/kg in the human brain using a 2D J-resolved metabolite-cycled (MC) semiLASER localization sequence at 9.4 T in the human brain. Methods Metabolite spectra were acquired in vivo using the newly developed J-resolved MC semiLASER localization sequence with maximum echo sampling (MES) at 9.4 T. In order to account for the underlying macromolecular (MM) spectra in the acquired metabolite spectra, J-resolved MM spectra were acquired using a double inversion recovery (DIR) J-resolved MC semiLASER. Spectral fitting was performed with ProFit 2.0 using a simulated basis set from VesPA tailored to 2D J-resolved semiLASER with MES. Finally, metabolite concentrations were calculated using internal water referencing. Results Tissue concentrations for 16 metabolites in mmol/kg are reported after correcting for number of protons, tissue content, and relaxation effects of both water and metabolites at 9.4T. Quantification results of spectra considering 8 and 2 averages per TE did not show any significant differences. Conclusion 2D spectra of metabolites acquired at 9.4T and 2D MMs acquired at any field strength are presented for the first time. Basis set simulation and quantification of metabolites for metabolite spectra acquired using maximum-echo-sampled 2D J-resolved semiLASER was performed for the first time. The sensitivity in the detection of J-coupled metabolites such as glutamine, glucose or lactate. At ultra-high field, the acquisition duration of 2D MRS can be also substantially reduced since only a very low number of averages per TE are needed.",

The aim of this study was to analyze the mechanism accounting for low-grade endotoxemia and its relationship with oxidative stress and clotting activation thrombosis in COVID-19. We measured serum levels of sNOX2-dp, zonulin, LPS, D-dimer, and albumin in 175 patients with COVID-19, classified as having or not acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and 50 healthy subjects. Baseline levels of sNOX2-dp, LPS, zonulin, D-dimer, albumin, and hs-CRP were significantly higher in COVID-19 compared to controls. In COVID-19 patients with ARDS, sNOX2-dp, LPS, zonulin, D-dimer, and hs-CRP were significantly higher compared to COVID-19 patients without ARDS. Conversely, concentration of albumin was lower in patients with ARDS compared with those without ARDS and inversely associated with LPS. In the COVID-19 cohort, the number of patients with ARDS progressively increased according to sNOX2-dp and LPS quartiles; a significant correlation between LPS and sNOX2-dp and LPS and D-dimer was detected in COVID-19. In a multivariable logistic regression model, LPS/albumin levels and D-dimer predicted thrombotic events. In COVID-19 patients, LPS is significantly associated with a hypercoagulation state and disease severity. In vitro, LPS can increase endothelial oxidative stress and coagulation biomarkers that were reduced by the treatment with albumin. In conclusion, impaired gut barrier permeability, increased NOX2 activation, and low serum albumin may account for low-grade endotoxemia and may be implicated in thrombotic events in COVID-19.",

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of such an intervention on health-related physical fitness and biomarkers in overweight COVID-19 survivors with varying degrees of symptom severity after 8 weeks and 16 weeks. Methods: This non-randomized clinical trial included 59 overweight COVID-19 survivors (32 males and 27 females) divided into three groups: mild (n = 31), moderate (n = 13), and severe/critical (n = 15). The participants underwent a multi-professional program and were assessed for anthropometric and body composition (primary outcome), as well as physical fitness and biochemical markers (secondary outcome) 8 and 16 weeks before the intervention. Results: After 8 weeks, time effects were observed for the maximum isometric handgrip strength (p < 0.001), maximum isometric lumbar-traction strength (p = 0.01), flexibility (p < 0.001), abdominal strength–endurance (p < 0.001), the sit-and-stand test (p < 0.001), maximum oxygen consumption (p < 0.001), and distance covered in the 6 min walk test (p < 0.001). Additionally, time effects were also observed for fat mass (p = 0.03), body fat percentage (p = 0.02), abdominal circumference (p = 0.01), total cholesterol (p < 0.001), low-density lipoproteins (p < 0.001), and glycated hemoglobin (p < 0.001), with lower values after multi-professional interventions. After 16 weeks, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure showed significant reductions independently of the intervention group (p < 0.001). Conclusion: These findings suggest that multi-professional interventions can provide substantial benefits for post-COVID-19 patients, regardless of the severity of their initial symptoms.",

Método: Foi realizada uma revisão integrativa da literatura, com a seguinte pergunta condutora: “A COVID-19 pode ser determinante para o desenvolvimento do AVE, aumentando a gravidade clínica do paciente?”. O recorte temporal abrangeu os anos de 2020 e 2021. As buscas foram feitas nas bases de dados LILACS, MEDLINE e SciELO. A extração de duplicatas e a triagem dos artigos foram realizadas com o auxílio de um gerenciador de referências. Resultados: Foram identificados 2.741 artigos, dos quais apenas 10 compuseram esta revisão. Os achados laboratoriais mais significativos em pacientes com COVID-19 e AVE foram níveis elevados de dímero-D, proteína C reativa, ferritina e leucócitos. Alguns dos artigos selecionados relataram a mortalidade como o principal desfecho para pacientes com COVID-19 e AVE. Conclusão: Os estudos indicaram casos frequentes de pacientes com COVID-19 grave que evoluíram para AVE, destacando-se a elevação de biomarcadores inflamatórios como preditores do AVE. Este estudo é de grande relevância social e científica, pois serve de base para novas pesquisas sobre o tema, orienta a tomada de decisão dos profissionais de saúde e contribui para a avaliação do prognóstico dos pacientes.",

It remains uncertain to what extent COVID-19 effects the heart in heathy individuals. To evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 on cardiac structure and function in middle-aged and older individuals.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA single-centre prospective observational study enroled a total of 124 participants (84 with history of COVID-19 [COVID-19 group] and 40 without a history of COVID-19 [non-COVID group]). All participants underwent echocardiography with speckle tracking to assess cardiac structure and function at rest and during peak exercise.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were no differences in left and right ventricular diastolic function (p ≥ 0.05) between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups. Participants in COVID-19 group demonstrated higher left ventricular mass (130 ± 39.8 vs. 113 ± 27.2 g, p = 0.008) and relative wall thickness (0.38 ± 0.07 vs. 0.36 ± 0.13, p = 0.049). Left ventricular global longitudinal strain was reduced in the COVID-19 group at rest and at peak-exercise (rest: 18.3 ± 2.01 vs. 19.3 ± 1.53%, p = 0.004; peak exercise: 19.1 ± 2.20 vs. 21.0 ± 1.58%, p ≤ 0.001). However, no difference was seen in resting left ventricular ejection fraction (58 ± 2.89 vs. 59 ± 2.51%, p = 0.565) between groups. Right ventricular fractional area change was reduced in the COVID-19 group (p = 0.012).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCardiac structural and functional remodelling was observed in middle-aged and older otherwise healthy individuals with a history of COVID-19.",

This review specifically examines the involvement of NO in age-related diseases, focusing on the cardiovascular, nervous, and immune systems. The discussion delves into the mechanisms of NO signaling in these diseases, emphasizing the post-translational modifications of involved proteins, such as S-nitrosation and nitration. The review also covers the dual nature of NO, highlighting both its protective and harmful effects, determined by concentration, location, and timing. Additionally, potential therapies that modulate NO signaling, including the use of NO donors and nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) inhibitors in the treatment of cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and oncological diseases, are analyzed. Particular attention is paid to the methods for the determination of NO and its derivatives in the context of illness diagnosis and monitoring. The review underscores the complexity and dual role of NO in maintaining cellular balance and suggests areas for future research in developing new therapeutic strategies.",

                "abstract": "An experiment was conducted to determine the effects of supplementing rumen-protected arginine (RPA) on productive performance in dairy cows. One-hundred and 2 cows were blocked by parity and then by energy-corrected milk (ECM) yield. Within block, cows were randomly assigned to control (CON) that received 200 g/d of a mixture of hydrogenated soybean oil and heat-treated soybean meal to supply 30 g of metabolizable protein (MP), or 200 g/d of a product containing 30 g of metabolizable arginine (RPA), which increased the dietary arginine from 5.7 to 7.5% of the MP from 250 d of gestation to 21 d postpartum. After 21 d postpartum, cows were fed the same diet and data were collected until 84 d postpartum. Cows fed RPA produced an additional 2.5 kg of colostrum (5.3 vs. 7.8 ± 1.0 kg) and 220 g more immunoglobulin G (526 vs. 746 ± 93 g) than CON cows. Supplementing RPA increased the yields of milk (32.8 vs. 34.9 ± 1.0 kg/d), ECM (37.8 vs. 40.9 ± 1.2 kg/d), and milk total solids (4.48 vs. 4.86 ± 0.14 kg/d) in the first 21 DIM. The benefits of RPA extended beyond the period of supplementation, with a 6.4% increase in yield of ECM per kg of dry matter consumed in all cows (1.88 vs. 2.00 ± 0.05 kg/kg) and an increase in ECM yield, but only in parous cows (44.2 vs. 48.5 ± 1.5 kg/d). Feeding RPA increased the concentrations of urea N in plasma pre- (12.5 vs. 13.9 ± 0.4 mg/dL) and postpartum (11.6 vs. 13.2 ± 0.4 mg/dL), and in milk during the first 21 d postpartum (11.0 vs. 12.0 ± 0.3 mg/dL). Treatment did not affect the concentrations of AA in plasma prepartum, but feeding RPA tended to increase citrulline (72.5 vs. 77.5 ± 2.7 μM), whereas RPA either tended to decrease isoleucine (129.5 vs. 120.9 ± 5.7 μM) or decreased the concentrations of leucine (181.3 vs. 170.2 ± 6.4 μM) and valine (293.2 vs. 276.7 ± 10.4 μM) postpartum. Feeding RPA increased the relative expression of transcripts involved in AA transport (SLC38A4), urea cycle (ARG1), and gluconeogenesis (PC, PEPCK, and G6PC) in hepatic tissue. Feeding diets to supply additional arginine as RPA during the transition period benefited productive performance in dairy cows that extended beyond the period of supplementation despite minor changes in plasma AA concentrations.",

However, greater attention is being directed to the specific pathophysiology underlying ACS, considering that plaque destabilization and rupture leading to luminal thrombotic obstruction is not the only pathway involved, albeit the most recognized. In this review, we discuss how intracoronary imaging and biomarkers allow the identification of specific ACS endotypes, leading to the recognition of different prognostic implications, tailored management strategies, and new potential therapeutic targets. Furthermore, different strategies can be applied on a personalized basis regarding antithrombotic therapy, non-culprit lesion revascularization, and microvascular obstruction (MVO). With respect to myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA), we will present a precision medicine approach, suggested by current guidelines as the mainstay of the diagnostic process and with relevant therapeutic implications. Moreover, we aim at illustrating the clinical implications of targeted strategies for ACS secondary prevention, which may lower residual risk in selected patients.",

                "abstract": "Background: Globally, Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) is a common cause of heart failure (HF), which has been a leading cause of mortality resulting from non-communicable diseases. On the other hand, increasing evidence suggests that the role of energy production within the mitochondria strongly links to the development and progression of heart diseases, while Cuproptosis, a newly identified cell death mechanism, has not yet been comprehensively analyzed from the aspect of cardiovascular medicine. Materials and Methods: 8 transcriptome profiles curated from the GEO database were integrated, from which a diagnostic model based on the Stacking algorithm was established. The efficacy of the model was evaluated in a multifaced manner (i.e., by Precision-Recall curve, Receiver Operative Characteristic curve, etc.). We also sequenced our animal models at the bulk RNA level and conducted qPCR and immunohistochemical staining, with which we further validated the expression of the key contributor gene to the model. Finally, we explored the immune implications of the key contributor gene. Results: A merged machine learning model containing 4 Cuproptosis-related genes (i.e., PDHB, CDKN2A, GLS, and SLC31A1) for robust AMI diagnosis was developed, in which SLC31A1 served as the key contributor. Through in vivo modeling, we validated the aberrant overexpression of SLC31A1 in AMI. Besides, further transcriptome analysis revealed that its high expression was correlated with significant potential immunological implications in the infiltration of many immune cell types, especially monocyte. Conclusions: We constructed an AMI diagnostic model based on Cuproptosis-related genes and validated the key contributor gene in animal modeling. We also analyzed the effects on the immune system for its overexpression in AMI.",

                "abstract": "Background: The C-reactive protein–albumin–lymphocyte (CALLY) index is a novel inflammatory biomarker, and its association with the prognosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has not previously been studied. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of using the CALLY index on adverse outcomes in CAD patients undergoing PCI. Methods: From December 2016 to October 2021, we consecutively enrolled 15,250 CAD patients and performed follow-ups for primary endpoints consisting of all-cause mortality (ACM) and cardiac mortality (CM). The CALLY index was computed using the following formula: (albumin × lymphocyte)/(C-reactive protein (CRP) × 104). The average duration of the follow-up was 24 months. Results: A total of 3799 CAD patients who had undergone PCI were ultimately enrolled in the present study. The patients were divided into four groups according to the CALLY index quartiles: Q1 (≤0.69, n = 950), Q2 (0.69–2.44, n = 950), Q3 (2.44–9.52, n = 950), and Q4 (>9.52, n = 949). The low-Q1 group had a significantly higher prevalence of ACM (p < 0.001), CM (p < 0.001), major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) (p = 0.002), and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) (p = 0.002). Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that a low CALLY index was significantly linked with adverse outcomes. After univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, the risk of ACM, CM, MACEs, and MACCEs decreased by 73.7% (adjust hazard risk [HR] = 0.263, 95% CI: 0.147–0.468, p < 0.001), 70.6% (adjust HR = 0.294, 95% CI: 0.150–0.579, p < 0. 001), 37.4% (adjust HR = 0.626, 95% CI: 0.422–0.929, p = 0.010), and 41.5% (adjust HR = 0.585, 95% CI: 0.401–0.856, p = 0.006), respectively, in the Q4 quartiles compared with the Q1 quartiles. Conclusions: This study revealed that a decreased CALLY index was associated with worse prognoses for CAD patients after PCI. The categorization of patients with a decreased CALLY index could provide valuable evidence for the risk stratification of adverse outcomes in CAD patients after PCI.

                "abstract": "Background: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a condition that affects a significant proportion of acutely unwell patients and is associated with a high mortality rate. Patients undergoing haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are in an extremely high group for AKI. Identifying a biomarker or panel of markers that can reliably identify at-risk individuals undergoing HSCT can potentially impact management and outcomes. Early identification of AKI can reduce its severity and improve prognosis. We evaluated the urinary Liver type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP), a tubular stress and injury biomarker both as an ELISA and a point of care (POC) assay for AKI detection in HSCT. Methods: 85 patients that had undergone autologous and allogenic HSCT (35 and 50, respectively) had urinary L-FABP (uL-FABP) measured by means of a quantitative ELISA and a semi-quantitative POC at baseline, day 0 and 7 post-transplantation. Serum creatinine (SCr) was also measured at the same time. Patients were followed up for 30 days for the occurrence of AKI and up to 18 months for mortality. The sensitivity and specificity of uL-FABP as an AKI biomarker were evaluated and compared to the performance of sCr using ROC curve analysis and logistic regression. Results: 39% of participants developed AKI within 1 month of their transplantation. The incidence of AKI was higher in the allogenic group than in the autologous HTSC group (57% vs. 26%, p = 0.008) with the median time to AKI being 25 [range 9-30] days. This group was younger (median age 59 vs. 63, p < 0.001) with a lower percentage of multiple myeloma as the primary diagnosis (6% vs. 88%, p < 0.001). The median time to AKI diagnosis was 25 [range 9–30] days. uL-FABP (mcg/gCr) at baseline, day of transplant and on the 7th day post-transplant were 1.61, 5.39 and 10.27, respectively, for the allogenic group and 0.58, 4.36 and 5.14 for the autologous group. Both SCr and uL-FABP levels rose from baseline to day 7 post-transplantation, while the AUC for predicting AKI for baseline, day 0 and day 7 post-transplant was 0.54, 0.59 and 0.62 for SCr and for 0.49, 0.43 and 0.49 uL-FABP, respectively. Univariate logistic regression showed the risk of AKI to be increased in patients with allogenic HSCT (p = 0.004, 95%CI [0.1; 0.65]) and in those with impaired renal function at baseline (p = 0.01, 95%CI [0.02, 0.54]). The risk of AKI was also significantly associated with SCr levels on day 7 post-transplant (p = 0.03, 95%CI [1; 1.03]). Multivariate logistic regression showed the type of HSCT to be the strongest predictor of AKI at all time points, while SCr levels at days 0 and 7 also correlated with increased risk in the model that included uL-FABP levels at the corresponding time points. The POC device for uL-FABP measurement correlated with ELISA (p < 0.001, Spearman ‘correlation’ = 0.54) Conclusions: The urinary biomarker uL-FABP did not demonstrate an independent predictive value in the detection of AKI at all stages. The most powerful risk predictor of AKI in this setting appears to be allograft recipients and baseline renal impairment, highlighting the importance of clinical risk stratification. Urinary L-FAPB as a POC biomarker was comparable to ELISA, which provides an opportunity for simple and rapid testing. However, the utility of LFABP in AKI is unclear and needs further exploration. Whether screening through rapid testing of uL-FABP can prevent or reduce AKI severity is unknown and merits further studies.",

Four diets were formulated with graded levels of rDDGS (0, 10, 14 and 18%). Each diet was allocated to 5 replicates with 10 birds in each at random. With the exception of 21 days, there was no difference in body weight gain, feed intake, or feed conversion ratio (FCR) among the treatment groups. The dietary levels of rDDGS had no effect on serum biochemical parameters. Dietary level of 14% rDDGS significantly increased dressing yield and thigh and drumstick percentage. The metabolizability of dry matter, crude protein, ether extract, crude fiber, nitrogen free extract and organic matter was similar among the experimental groups. The addition of rDDGS had no negative effects on jejunum histo-morphometry. In the 18% rDDGS fed group, profit per kg live weight was comparatively higher. In conclusion, rDDGS may be added to dual-purpose chicken diets safely up to an 18% inclusion level as a substitute protein source for profitable production.",

In the present study, we identified that the lncRNA NEAT1 is upregulated in failing murine hearts and in human hypertrophic cardiomyopathies. Further investigations demonstrated that NEAT1 expression is regulated by calcium dependent NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells). Overexpression of NEAT1 led to increased cardiomyocyte size and elevated expression of cardiac stress markers while its depletion had the opposite effect. Through transcriptomic analysis in NEAT1-KO cells, we demonstrated the cis-regulatory role of NEAT1, wherein it maintains the transcription of neighboring genes by interacting with the coactivator p300. Additionally, NEAT1 depletion resulted in decreased expression of GRK2 (G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2), a key player in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, suggesting that NEAT1 contributes to the development of cardiac hypertrophy by regulating GRK2 expression. Consistent with this, Neat1-/- mice are resistant to β-adrenergic stimulation. Overall, our study provides enough evidence that NEAT1 is a calcium-regulated, pro-hypertrophic lncRNA that exerts significant control over the transcriptional landscape of cardiomyocytes during heart failure.",

                "abstract": "GPCRs (G protein-coupled receptors), also known as 7 transmembrane domain receptors, are the largest receptor family in the human genome, with ≈800 members. GPCRs regulate nearly every aspect of human physiology and disease, thus serving as important drug targets in cardiovascular disease. Sharing a conserved structure comprised of 7 transmembrane α-helices, GPCRs couple to heterotrimeric G-proteins, GPCR kinases, and β-arrestins, promoting downstream signaling through second messengers and other intracellular signaling pathways. GPCR drug development has led to important cardiovascular therapies, such as antagonists of β-adrenergic and angiotensin II receptors for heart failure and hypertension, and agonists of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor for reducing adverse cardiovascular events and other emerging indications. There continues to be a major interest in GPCR drug development in cardiovascular and cardiometabolic disease, driven by advances in GPCR mechanistic studies and structure-based drug design. This review recounts the rich history of GPCR research, including the current state of clinically used GPCR drugs, and highlights newly discovered aspects of GPCR biology and promising directions for future investigation. As additional mechanisms for regulating GPCR signaling are uncovered, new strategies for targeting these ubiquitous receptors hold tremendous promise for the field of cardiovascular medicine.",

Up to now, there has been no plausible evolutionary narrative that may account for the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. This study provides structural and biochemical evidence that two bat SARS2-like coronaviruses, BANAL-236 and RaTG13, can use mouse ACE2 as their entry receptor. Moreover, the furin motif is a common feature of rodent coronaviruses. Therefore, it is possible that bat coronaviruses may have coinfected rodents, where their spike genes recombined and subsequently evolved the furin motif, leading to the spike protein observed in SARS-CoV-2. Our research provides the foundational structural and biochemical understanding for further studies into the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2.",

                "abstract": "The emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants can affect vaccine efficacy, laboratory diagnosis and the therapies already available, triggering interest in the search for antiviral agents for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Ribavirin (RBV) is a broad-spectrum antiviral with demonstrated in vitro activity against multiple viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. This retrospective study evaluated the dynamics and viral clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalised adult participants (PTs) with COVID-19 pneumonia who received an RBV aerosol within a compassionate use study. The impact of RBV on the clinical outcome and the mutational profile of SARS-CoV-2 was also assessed. The median RNA values measured in nine PTs included in this study decreased from baseline to discharge (at BL, threshold cycle (Ct) = 22.4, IQR 19.84–5.07; at discharge, Ct = 27.92, IQR 26.43–36.11), with a significant decline in the Ct value evaluated by Friedman rank ANOVA analysis, p = 0.032. Seven out of nine PTs experienced a clinical improvement, while two PTs deceased during hospitalisation. In PTs with a favourable outcome, the virus clearance rate at discharge was 28.6%. The cumulative clearance rate was 71.4% within 14 days from discharge. A mutational pattern after RBV was detected in three out of five PTs in whom whole-genome sequencing was available. Our findings suggest that RBV limits SARS-CoV-2 replication, possibly resulting in a favourable clinical outcome. Ribavirin may also contribute to the mutational spectrum of SARS-CoV-2.",

                "abstract": "Increased plasma creatine concentrations are associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes, but whether this alteration is associated with or causal for impairments in metabolism remains unexplored. Because skeletal muscle is the main disposal site of both creatine and glucose, we investigated the role of intramuscular creatine metabolism in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. In men with type 2 diabetes, plasma creatine concentrations were increased, and intramuscular phosphocreatine content was reduced. These alterations were coupled to reduced expression of sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase 2 (CKMT2). In C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet, neither supplementation with creatine for 2 weeks nor treatment with the creatine analog β-GPA for 1 week induced changes in glucose tolerance, suggesting that increased circulating creatine was associated with insulin resistance rather than causing it. In C2C12 myotubes, silencing Ckmt2 using small interfering RNA reduced mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential, and glucose oxidation. Electroporation-mediated overexpression of Ckmt2 in skeletal muscle of high-fat diet–fed male mice increased mitochondrial respiration, independent of creatine availability. Given that overexpression of Ckmt2 improved mitochondrial function, we explored whether exercise regulates CKMT2 expression. Analysis of public data revealed that CKMT2 content was up-regulated by exercise training in both humans and mice. We reveal a previously underappreciated role of CKMT2 in mitochondrial homeostasis beyond its function for creatine phosphorylation, independent of insulin action. Collectively, our data provide functional evidence for how CKMT2 mediates mitochondrial dysfunction associated with type 2 diabetes. Mitochondrial creatine kinase 2 is decreased in type 2 diabetes, which impairs skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. Editor’s summary Increased plasma creatine is associated with type 2 diabetes, but causation has not been established. Rizo-Roca et al. show that men with type 2 diabetes had increased plasma creatine and decreased muscle phosphocreatine, which was associated with poor glucose handling. In myotubes in vitro, silencing the mitochondria-associated sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase 2 (Ckmt2) gene resulted in impaired mitochondrial functions. In mice fed a high-fat diet, creatine supplementation had no effect on glucose handling, but overexpression of Ckmt2 in muscle improved mitochondrial functions. Data from humans and mice showed that exercise increased CKMT2 and metrics of mitochondrial functions. These results suggest that creatine changes are a consequence rather than a cause of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. —Brandon Berry",

                "abstract": "PURPOSE\nFollowing acute myocardial infarction (AMI), patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have a poorer prognosis than those without DM. This study aimed to investigate the benefit of cardiac rehabilitation on cardiorespiratory fitness in patients with AMI, examining whether this effect varied depending on DM and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels.\n\n\nMETHODS\nData were collected from the medical records of 324 patients diagnosed with AMI who were subsequently referred to participate in a supervised exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation program. Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed using cardiopulmonary exercise testing before and at 3 and 6 mo after the start of cardiac rehabilitation. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate changes in cardiorespiratory fitness between patients with and without DM during the follow-up period.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn total, 106 patients (33%) had DM. Both patients with and without DM showed a significant improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness from baseline to the 6-mo follow-up. However, the improvement was significantly lower in patients with DM than in those without DM (1.9 ± 1.5 vs. 3.7 ± 3.2 mL/kg/min, P < .001). Among patients with DM, those with HbA1c levels < 7% showed a greater improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness than those with HbA1c ≥ 7% (2.7 ± 1.5 vs. 1.1 ± 1.8 mL/kg/min, P < .001) during the follow-up period.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nImprovements in cardiorespiratory fitness following cardiac rehabilitation were significantly lower in patients with AMI and DM. The response to cardiac rehabilitation in patients is influenced by HbA1c levels. These findings suggest potential implications for individualizing cardiac rehabilitation programming and ensuring optimal glycemic control in patients with AMI and DM.",

                "abstract": "AIMS\nSkeletal muscle, with its remarkable plasticity and dynamic adaptation, serves as a cornerstone of locomotion and metabolic homeostasis in the human body. Muscle tissue, with its extraordinary capacity for force generation and energy expenditure, plays a fundamental role in the movement, metabolism, and overall health. In this context, we sought to determine the role of p38α in mitochondrial metabolism since mitochondrial dynamics play a crucial role in the development of muscle-related diseases that result in muscle weakness.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted our study using male mice (MCK-cre, p38αMCK-KO and PGC1α MCK-KO) and mouse primary myoblasts. We analyzed mitochondrial metabolic, physiological parameters as well as proteomics, western blot, RNA-seq analysis from muscle samples.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur findings highlight the critical involvement of muscle p38α in the regulation of mitochondrial function, a key determinant of muscle strength. The absence of p38α triggers changes in mitochondrial dynamics through the activation of PGC1α, a central regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. These results have substantial implications for understanding the complex interplay between p38α kinase, PGC1α activation, and mitochondrial content, thereby enhancing our knowledge in the control of muscle biology.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis knowledge holds relevance for conditions associated with muscle weakness, where disruptions in these molecular pathways are frequently implicated in diminishing physical strength. Our research underscores the potential importance of targeting the p38α and PGC1α pathways within muscle, offering promising avenues for the advancement of innovative treatments. Such interventions hold the potential to improve the quality of life for individuals affected by muscle-related diseases.",

                "abstract": "During skeletal muscle adaptation to physiological or pathophysiological signals, contractile apparatus and mitochondrial function are coordinated to alter muscle fiber type. Although recent studies have identified various factors involved in modifying contractile proteins and mitochondrial function, the molecular mechanisms coordinating contractile and metabolic functions during muscle fiber transition are not fully understood. Using a gene-deficient mouse approach, our previous studies uncovered that vestigial-like family member 2 (Vgll2), a skeletal muscle-specific transcription cofactor activated by exercise, is essential for fast-to-slow adaptation of skeletal muscle. The current study provides evidence that Vgll2 plays a role in increasing muscle mitochondrial mass and oxidative capacity. Transgenic Vgll2 overexpression in mice altered muscle fiber composition toward the slow type and enhanced exercise endurance, which contradicted the outcomes observed with Vgll2 deficiency. Vgll2 expression was positively correlated with the expression of genes related to mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle, mitochondrial DNA content, and protein abundance of oxidative phosphorylation complexes. Additionally, Vgll2 overexpression significantly increased the maximal respiration of isolated muscle fibers and enhanced the suppressive effects of endurance training on weight gain. Notably, no additional alteration in expression of myosin heavy chain genes was observed after exercise, suggesting that Vgll2 plays a direct role in regulating mitochondrial function, independent of its effect on contractile components. The observed increase in exercise endurance and metabolic efficiency may be attributed to the acute upregulation of genes promoting fatty acid utilization as a direct consequence of Vgll2 activation facilitated by endurance exercise. Thus, the current study establishes that Vgll2 is an integrative regulator of mitochondrial function and contractility in skeletal muscle.",

                "abstract": "Increased plasma creatine concentrations are associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes, but whether this alteration is associated with or causal for impairments in metabolism remains unexplored. Because skeletal muscle is the main disposal site of both creatine and glucose, we investigated the role of intramuscular creatine metabolism in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. In men with type 2 diabetes, plasma creatine concentrations were increased, and intramuscular phosphocreatine content was reduced. These alterations were coupled to reduced expression of sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase 2 (CKMT2). In C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet, neither supplementation with creatine for 2 weeks nor treatment with the creatine analog β-GPA for 1 week induced changes in glucose tolerance, suggesting that increased circulating creatine was associated with insulin resistance rather than causing it. In C2C12 myotubes, silencing Ckmt2 using small interfering RNA reduced mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential, and glucose oxidation. Electroporation-mediated overexpression of Ckmt2 in skeletal muscle of high-fat diet–fed male mice increased mitochondrial respiration, independent of creatine availability. Given that overexpression of Ckmt2 improved mitochondrial function, we explored whether exercise regulates CKMT2 expression. Analysis of public data revealed that CKMT2 content was up-regulated by exercise training in both humans and mice. We reveal a previously underappreciated role of CKMT2 in mitochondrial homeostasis beyond its function for creatine phosphorylation, independent of insulin action. Collectively, our data provide functional evidence for how CKMT2 mediates mitochondrial dysfunction associated with type 2 diabetes. Mitochondrial creatine kinase 2 is decreased in type 2 diabetes, which impairs skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. Editor’s summary Increased plasma creatine is associated with type 2 diabetes, but causation has not been established. Rizo-Roca et al. show that men with type 2 diabetes had increased plasma creatine and decreased muscle phosphocreatine, which was associated with poor glucose handling. In myotubes in vitro, silencing the mitochondria-associated sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase 2 (Ckmt2) gene resulted in impaired mitochondrial functions. In mice fed a high-fat diet, creatine supplementation had no effect on glucose handling, but overexpression of Ckmt2 in muscle improved mitochondrial functions. Data from humans and mice showed that exercise increased CKMT2 and metrics of mitochondrial functions. These results suggest that creatine changes are a consequence rather than a cause of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. —Brandon Berry",

We sought to genetically encode mammalian transfection sensor (Trensor) circuits and test their utility in HeLa cells for detecting molecules and methods for their propensity to influence transfection. We intended these Trensor circuits to be triggered if their host cell was treated with polyplexed pDNA or certain small-molecule modulators of transfection. We prioritized three promoters, implicated by others in feedback responses as cells import and process foreign material and stably integrated each into the genomes of three different cell lines, each upstream of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) open reading frame within a transgene. All three Trensor circuits showed an increase in their GFP expression when their host HeLa cells were incubated with pDNA and the degraded polyamidoamine dendrimer reagent, SuperFect. We next experimentally demonstrated the modulation of PEI-mediated HeLa cell transient transfection by four different small molecules, with Trichostatin A (TSA) showing the greatest propensity to boost transgene expression. The Trensor circuit based on the TRA2B promoter (Trensor-T) was triggered by incubation with TSA alone and not the other three small molecules. These data suggest that mammalian reporter circuits could enable low-cost, high-throughput screening to identify novel transfection methods and reagents without the need to perform actual transfections requiring costly plasmids or expensive fluorescent labels.",

As many as five of six patients with orofacial pain can present with sleep problems. The comorbidity of orofacial pain and sleep disorders overlays a complex web of altered neurobiological mechanisms that predispose to the chronification of orofacial pain. This review discusses the relationship between orofacial pain and sleep disorders and highlights their interactions and the neurobiological mechanisms underlying those relationships.",

                "abstract": "Circadian fluctuations in physiological setpoints are determined by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) which exerts control over many target structures within and beyond the hypothalamus via projections. The SCN, or central pacemaker, orchestrates synchrony between the external environment and the internal circadian mechanism. The resulting cycles in hormone levels and autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity provide precise messages to specific organs, adjusting, for example, their sensitivity to approaching hormones or metabolites. The SCN responds to both photic (light) and non-photic input. Circadian patterns are found in both heart rate and blood pressure, which are linked to daily variations in activity and autonomic nervous system activity. Variations in blood pressure are of great interest as several cardiovascular diseases such as stroke, arrhythmias, and hypertension are linked to circadian rhythm dysregulation. The disruption of normal day-night cycles, such as in shift work, social jetlag, or eating outside of normal hours leads to desynchronization of the central and peripheral clocks. This desynchronization leads to disorganization of the cellular processes that are normally driven by the interactions of the SCN and photic input. Here, we review autonomic system function and dysfunction due to regulation and interaction between different cardiorespiratory brain centers and the SCN, as well as social, lifestyle, and external factors that may impact the circadian control of blood pressure.",

                "abstract": "Background: A circadian rhythm of myocardial infarction has been described but there is little data on its relation with seasons and months. Methods: From June 2013 to June 2018, we analyzed the alerts for acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in a Spanish region with 6.64 million inhabitants, universal health coverage, and an organized STEMI reperfusion network. We selected those patients which an identifiable culprit plaque. Results: We recruited 6765 cases of STEMI due to type I acute myocardial infarction (type-I AMI), with mean age of 63.2 years (range 17–101, standard deviation [SD] 13.7), 5238 were males (77.4%) and 2801 (41.9%) were 65 years or older. The hourly distribution followed a fixed pattern in all months, with most of the events occurring between 6:00 AM and 4:00 PM, a peak at approximately 01:00 PM and a valley between 10:00 PM and 06:00 AM. No significant difference was found when comparing the mean time to first medical contact between July (the month with more daylight hours) and December (the month with shortest days). No significant differences were found between male and female patients, or between patients aged 65 years or older and younger patients. There was a close correlation between the number of events per month and the number of events occurring during the day (6 AM to 6 PM, r = 0.988, p = 0.001) and during the night (6 PM to 6 AM, r = 0.944, p < 0.001), with different slopes of the regression lines (t-test, p < 0.001), so that the difference between day-night occurrences increased with the total incidence. Conclusions: There is a circadian pattern in the presentation of STEMI that is not influenced by sex and age. The different incidence of STEMI at different times of the year does not affect the circadian pattern in terms of the shape of the curve or the mean time of presentation, although diurnal events increase more than nocturnal events, suggesting that triggers are most likely to act during vulnerable periods as determined by a circadian-based rhythm.",

Genomic DNA extraction was done from lymphocytes using conventional techniques, employing the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) from lymphocytes. Genotyping was conducted through TaqMan single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping assays, employing real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). This streamlined approach ensures accurate and efficient analysis of genetic markers associated with MI across gender groups.\n\n\n\nThe study revealed significant associations between body mass index (BMI), hypertension, obesity, current smoking, and type 2 diabetes among both male and female MI patients. However, age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) did not exhibit significant differences between genders. Analysis of CLOCK rs4580704 polymorphism indicated no variance in genotype and allele frequencies between male and female MI patients. When considering both genders, CLOCK rs4580704 polymorphism was significantly associated with BMI, hypertension, obesity, current smoking, and type 2 diabetes (P = 0.02, P = 0.02, P = 0.04, and P = 0.02, respectively). Nevertheless, logistic regression analysis showed no significant differences among MI cases across the various models of CLOCK rs4580704 polymorphism.\n\n\n\nNo significant association was found between CLOCK rs4580704 polymorphism and MI in both genders. However, significant links were identified between this polymorphism and various cardiovascular risk factors including BMI, SBP, DBP, hypertension, obesity, current smoking, and type 2 diabetes in MI cases. These findings underscore the potential influence of CLOCK rs4580704 polymorphism on cardiovascular risk profiles among individuals with MI.\n",

Sophora flavescens is a widely used traditional herbal medicine in clinical practice, known for its abundant flavonoids as the main active compounds. However, there has been no comprehensive analysis of S. flavescens bHLH (SfbHLH) gene family reported currently. In this study, we identified 167 SfbHLH genes and classified them into 23 subfamilies based on comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, widespread duplications significantly contributed to the expansion of SfbHLH family. Notably, SfbHLH042 was found to occupy a central position in the bHLH protein-protein interaction network. Transcriptome analysis of four tissues (leaf, stem, root and flower) revealed that most SfbHLH genes exhibited high expression levels exclusively in specific tissues of S. flavescens. The integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics during pod development stages revealed that SfbHLH042 may play a central role in connecting SfbHLH genes, flavonoids, and key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis pathway. Moreover, we also checked the expression of 8 SfbHLH genes using RT-qPCR analysis to realize the expression profiles of these genes among various tissues at different cultivated periods and root development. Our study would aid to understand the phylogeny and expression profile of SfbHLH family genes, and provide a promising candidate gene, SfbHLH042, for regulating the biosynthesis of flavonoids in S. flavescens.",

As a well-known regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition or embryonic organogenesis, Twist1 is important in a variety of developmental systems, including mesoderm formation, neurogenesis, myogenesis, cranial neural crest cell migration, and differentiation. In this review, we first highlight the physiological significance of Twist1 in cell differentiation, including osteogenic, chondrogenic, and myogenic differentiation, and then detail its probable molecular processes and signaling pathways. On this premise, we summarize the significance of Twist1 in distinct developmental disorders and diseases to provide a reference for studies on cell differentiation/development-related diseases.",

                "abstract": "Abstract Animals rely on their nervous systems to process sensory inputs, integrate these with internal signals, and produce behavioral outputs. This is enabled by the highly specialized morphologies and functions of neurons. Neuronal cells share multiple structural and physiological features, but they also come in a large diversity of types or classes that give the nervous system its broad range of functions and plasticity. This diversity, first recognized over a century ago, spurred classification efforts based on morphology, function, and molecular criteria. Caenorhabditis elegans, with its precisely mapped nervous system at the anatomical level, an extensive molecular description of most of its neurons, and its genetic amenability, has been a prime model for understanding how neurons develop and diversify at a mechanistic level. Here, we review the gene regulatory mechanisms driving neurogenesis and the diversification of neuron classes and subclasses in C. elegans. We discuss our current understanding of the specification of neuronal progenitors and their differentiation in terms of the transcription factors involved and ensuing changes in gene expression and chromatin landscape. The central theme that has emerged is that the identity of a neuron is defined by modules of gene batteries that are under control of parallel yet interconnected regulatory mechanisms. We focus on how, to achieve these terminal identities, cells integrate information along their developmental lineages. Moreover, we discuss how neurons are diversified postembryonically in a time-, genetic sex-, and activity-dependent manner. Finally, we discuss how the understanding of neuronal development can provide insights into the evolution of neuronal diversity.",

                "abstract": "Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) commonly show specific cognitive deficits in addition to a severe muscle impairment caused by the absence of dystrophin expression in skeletal muscle. These cognitive deficits have been related to the absence of dystrophin in specific regions of the central nervous system, notably cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs). Dystrophin has recently been involved in GABAA receptors clustering at postsynaptic densities, and its absence, by disrupting this clustering, leads to decreased inhibitory input to PC. We performed an in vivo electrophysiological study of the dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy X-linked (mdx) mouse model of DMD to compare PC firing and local field potential (LFP) in alert mdx and control C57Bl/10 mice. We found that the absence of dystrophin is associated with altered PC firing and the emergence of fast (~160-200 Hz) LFP oscillations in the cerebellar cortex of alert mdx mice. These abnormalities were not related to the disrupted expression of calcium-binding proteins in cerebellar PC. We also demonstrate that cerebellar long-term depression is altered in alert mdx mice. Finally, mdx mice displayed a force weakness, mild impairment of motor coordination and balance during behavioural tests. These findings demonstrate the existence of cerebellar dysfunction in mdx mice. A similar cerebellar dysfunction may contribute to the cognitive deficits observed in patients with DMD.",

                "abstract": "Background The pathology in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by degenerating muscle fibers, inflammation, fibro-fatty infiltrate, and edema, and these pathological processes replace normal healthy muscle tissue. The mdx mouse model is one of the most commonly used preclinical models to study DMD. Mounting evidence has emerged illustrating that muscle disease progression varies considerably in mdx mice, with inter-animal differences as well as intra-muscular differences in pathology in individual mdx mice. This variation is important to consider when conducting assessments of drug efficacy and in longitudinal studies. We developed a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation and analysis pipeline to rapidly and non-invasively measure the severity of muscle disease in mdx mice. Methods Wildtype and mdx mice were imaged with MRI and T2 maps were obtained axially across the hindlimbs. A neural network was trained to rapidly and semi-automatically segment the muscle tissue, and the distribution of resulting T2 values was analyzed. Interdecile range and Pearson Skew were identified as biomarkers to quickly and accurately estimate muscle disease severity in mice. Results The semiautomated segmentation tool reduced image processing time approximately tenfold. Measures of Pearson skew and interdecile range based on that segmentation were repeatable and reflected muscle disease severity in healthy wildtype and diseased mdx mice based on both qualitative observation of images and correlation with Evans blue dye uptake. Conclusion Use of this rapid, non-invasive, semi-automated MR image segmentation and analysis pipeline has the potential to transform preclinical studies, allowing for pre-screening of dystrophic mice prior to study enrollment to ensure more uniform muscle disease pathology across treatment groups, improving study outcomes.",

Part of the Ca2+ accumulates in the mitochondria, contributing to the development of mitochondrial dysfunction and degeneration of muscles. In this work, we assessed the effect of intraperitoneal administration of rhodacyanine MKT077 (5 mg/kg/day), which is able to suppress glucose-regulated protein 75 (GRP75)-mediated Ca2+ transfer from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) to mitochondria, on the Ca2+ overload of skeletal muscle mitochondria in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice and the concomitant mitochondrial dysfunction contributing to muscle pathology. MKT077 prevented Ca2+ overload of quadriceps mitochondria in mdx mice, reduced the intensity of oxidative stress, and improved mitochondrial ultrastructure, but had no effect on impaired oxidative phosphorylation. MKT077 eliminated quadriceps calcification and reduced the intensity of muscle fiber degeneration, fibrosis level, and normalized grip strength in mdx mice. However, we noted a negative effect of MKT077 on wild-type mice, expressed as a decrease in the efficiency of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, SR stress development, ultrastructural disturbances in the quadriceps, and a reduction in animal endurance in the wire-hanging test. This paper discusses the impact of MKT077 modulation of mitochondrial dysfunction on the development of skeletal muscle pathology in mdx mice.",

Increasing evidence supports the contributing role of satellite cells in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a lethal degenerative muscle disease caused by loss of dystrophin. We used single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to determine how dystrophin deficiency impacts satellite cell heterogeneity and function. scRNA-seq was performed in satellite cells from mdx and D2-mdx DMD mouse models. DMD satellite cells were disproportionally found within myogenic progenitor clusters and a unique DMD enriched cluster. DMD satellite cells and myogenic progenitors exhibited distinct impairments, including cell death and senescence, respectively. Moreover, dystrophic satellite cells express an impaired myogenic differentiation gene signature and are stalled in their differentiation capacity. We found that inducing autophagy, which is reduced in DMD progenitors, led to enhanced differentiation. Our findings provide molecular evidence of satellite cell dysfunction in DMD and suggest pathways to target and enhance their regenerative capacity.",

Inactivation of platelet COX-1 is cumulative upon repeated daily dosing, because of the irreversible nature of enzyme acetylation, ensuring virtually complete suppression of thromboxane (TX) A2 biosynthesis at very low daily doses and limited interindividual variability. In randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, suppression of TXA2-dependent platelet activation by low-dose aspirin reduces risk of coronary atherothrombosis and its recurrence, increases risk of gastrointestinal bleeding from pre-existing mucosal lesions, and decreases risk of sporadic colorectal (CR) adenoma recurrence.

Although aspirin has been in use for decades, the available evidence for its efficacy largely predates the introduction of other drugs, such as statins and P2Y12 inhibitors. Based on recent trials, the recommendation for aspirin use as primary prevention has been downgraded. In addition, P2Y12 inhibitors given as a single antiplatelet therapy have been associated with a lower incidence of bleeding than dual antiplatelet therapy in combination with aspirin in patients with stable and unstable coronary artery disease. The aim of this review is to discuss the role of aspirin considering the available evidence for primary prevention, secondary prevention for stable coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndromes, and after percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass revascularization.",

To address this issue, an in-hospital mini-tablet formulation of acetylsalicylic acid was developed. In order to use the mini-tablets safely and effectively, dissolution tests alone are not sufficient. Therefore, an open-label crossover study on six healthy participants was conducted to evaluate comparative pharmacokinetic parameters. The pharmacokinetic parameters of salicylic acid were Cmax: 4.80 ± 0.79 mg/L (powder; P), 5.03 ± 0.97 mg/L (mini-tablet; MT), AUC0–12: 18.0 ± 3.03 mg-h/L (P), 18.9 ± 4.59 mg-h/L (MT), those of acetylsalicylic acid Cmax: 0.50 ± 0.20 mg/L (P), 0.41 ± 0.24 mg/L (MT), AUC0–12: 0.71 ± 0.27 mg-h/L (P), 0.61 ± 0.36 mg-h/L (MT), with no significant differences between the mini-tablet and powder formulations. Although pharmacokinetic results obtained from adults cannot be directly applied to children, the results of this study are important for predicting pharmacokinetics. Furthermore, a formulation that can improve medication adherence in children who have difficulty taking acetylsalicylic acid powder, thus contributing to pediatric drug therapy.",

                "abstract": "Even before its role in platelet inhibition was fully characterized in the 1980s, aspirin had been incorporated into the cardiovascular disease care algorithm. Early trials examining its use in unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction revealed evidence of its protective role in the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Large trials assessing use in the primary prevention setting and optimal dosing regimens were studied in the late 1990s and early 2000s. As a cornerstone of cardiovascular care, aspirin was incorporated into primary and secondary ASCVD prevention guidelines in the United States and mechanical heart valve guidelines. However, in recent years, with significant advances in medical and interventional ASCVD therapies, scrutiny has been placed on the bleeding profile of aspirin, and guidelines have adapted to new evidence. Updates in primary prevention guidelines reserve aspirin only for patients at higher ASCVD risk and low bleeding risk - though questions remain in ASCVD risk assessment as risk-enhancing factors have proven difficult to incorporate on a population level. New thoughts regarding aspirin use in secondary prevention - especially with the concomitant use of anticoagulants - have altered recommendations as additional data accrued. Finally, a recommendation for aspirin and vitamin K antagonists with mechanical heart valves has been modified. Despite aspirin losing a foothold in cardiovascular care, new evidence has strengthened claims for its use in women at high risk for preeclampsia.",

We aim to evaluate the association between cardiac troponin and coronary plaque composition in such patients. Methods In a prespecified secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study, blinded quantitative plaque analysis was performed on 242 CT coronary angiograms of patients with acute chest pain in whom myocardial infarction was excluded. Patients were stratified by peak plasma cardiac troponin I concentration ≥5 ng/L or <5 ng/L. Associations were assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Results The cohort was predominantly middle-aged (62±12 years) men (69%). Patients with plasma cardiac troponin I concentration ≥5 ng/L (n=161) had a higher total (median 33% (IQR 0–47) vs 0% (IQR 0–33)), non-calcified (27% (IQR 0–37) vs 0% (IQR 0–28)), calcified (2% (IQR 0–8) vs 0% (IQR 0–3)) and low-attenuation (1% (IQR 0–3) vs 0% (IQR 0–1)) coronary plaque burden compared with those with concentrations <5 ng/L (n=81; p≤0.001 for all). Low-attenuation plaque burden was independently associated with plasma cardiac troponin I concentration ≥5 ng/L after adjustment for clinical characteristics (adjusted OR per doubling 1.62 (95% CI 1.17 to 2.32), p=0.005) or presence of any visible coronary artery disease (adjusted OR per doubling 1.57 (95% CI 1.07 to 2.37), p=0.026). Conclusion In patients with acute chest pain but without myocardial infarction, plasma cardiac troponin I concentrations ≥5 ng/L are associated with greater burden of low-attenuation coronary plaque.",

We have previously developed a fitting software called ProFit-1D which was shown to fit 9.4T semi-LASER data from the human brain with high accuracy and precision. In this study, we adapted ProFit-1D to fit J-difference edited spectra acquired at a clinical field strength of 3T and to assessed its performance in simulated and in vivo data. ProFit-1D was adapted to fit J-difference edited data with alterations to the fitting range to exclude the 1.3 ppm lipid resonance, starting T2 relaxation constants, initial fit parameters, and adaptive spectral baseline determination. The accuracy of ProFit-1D was systematically evaluated on simulated GABA-edited and 2-hydroxyglutarate-edited (2HG-edited) data with different types of in vivo parameter variations and compared to that of LCModel and Gannet, two software commonly used to fit J-difference edited data. The precision of ProFit-1D was also evaluated in GABA-edited spectra acquired in vivo in the occipital cortex (OCC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of healthy participants at 3T using subsets of averages and compared to that of LCModel and Gannet. The 2HG fit error was also evaluated for ProFit-1D in 2HG-edited spectra acquired in glioma patients and compared to that of LCModel. Overall, it was found that ProFit-1D generally produced fits with low parameter fit errors across a variety of parameter variations. GABA, glutamate plus glutamine (Glx), and 2HG levels were also more accurately estimated with ProFit-1D than with LCModel and Gannet across different spectral disturbances and simulated concentrations. ProFit-1D was found to be as precise as LCModel and more precise than Gannet in estimating GABA and Glx. 2HG fit errors were 45% lower with ProFit-1D than with LCModel. Thus, ProFit-1D was found to produce high-quality fits to J- difference edited data with high accuracy and precision.",

                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The pathophysiological basis of neurological decompression sickness and the association between cerebral subcortical white matter (WM) change and nonhypoxic hypobaria remain poorly understood. Recent study of altitude decompression sickness risk evaluated acute WM responses to intensive hypobaric exposure using brain magnetic resonance imaging.\nMETHODS: Six healthy men (20 to 50 yr) completed 6 h of hyperoxic hypobaria during three same-day altitude chamber decompressions to pressure altitudes ≥ 22,000 ft (6706 m). Research magnetic resonance imaging sequences, conducted on the days preceding and following decompression, evaluated subcortical WM integrity, cerebral blood flow, neuronal integrity (fractional anisotropy), and neurometabolite concentrations.\nRESULTS: No subcortical lesions were evident on diffusion weighted imaging and WM fractional anisotropy was unaffected. Mean WM blood flow was upregulated by 20% to over 25 mL · 100 g−1 · min−1. Gray matter flow was unchanged. There were no changes in gray matter or cerebellar neurometabolites. In parietal subcortical WM, levels of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) fell from (mean ± SD) 1.68 ± 0.2 to 1.35 ± 0.3 institutional units while glutathione (GSH) fell from 1.71 ± 0.4 to 1.25 ± 0.3 institutional units. Lactate increased postexposure in five subjects.\nCONCLUSIONS: Postexposure decrements in GABA and GSH imply WM insult with loss of neuroprotection and oxidative stress. An association between decrements in GABA and GSH support a common origin, while GSH decrements also correlate with WM blood flow responses. WM lactate increments are prone to error but suggest dysregulation of subcortical microvascular flow. WM neurometabolite and blood flow indices did not normalize by 24 h postexposure.\nConnolly D, Davagnanam I, Wylezinska-Arridge M, Mallon D, Wastling S, Lee VM.

At higher field strengths (i.e., 7T), there is better separation of these signals. As the availability of higher field strengths is increasing, it is important to re-evaluate the separability of overlapping metabolite signals.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis study compares the ability of stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM-8; TE = 8 ms), short-TE semi-LASER (sLASER-34; TE = 34 ms), and long-TE semi-LASER (sLASER-105; TE = 105 ms) acquisitions to separate the commonly acquired neurochemicals at 7T (Glx, consisting of glutamate and glutamine; total N-acetyl aspartate, consisting of N-acetyl aspartate and N-acetylaspartylglutamate; total creatine, consisting of creatine and phosphocreatine; and total choline, consisting of choline, phosphocholine, and glycerophosphocholine).\n\n\nRESULTS\nsLASER-34 produced the lowest fit errors for most neurochemicals; however, STEAM-8 had better within-subject reproducibility and required fewer subjects to detect a change between groups. However, this is dependent on the neurochemical of interest.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe recommend short-TE STEAM for separation of most standard neurochemicals at 7T over short-TE or long-TE sLASER.",

                "abstract": "Background: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a chronic medical condition with no specific pharmacological treatment. Creatine, a nutrient essential for maintaining energy homeostasis in the cells, is a candidate for interventions in ME/CFS. Methods: Fourteen participants with ME/CFS received supplementation with 16 g creatine monohydrate for 6 weeks. Before starting creatine and on the last day of treatment, participants underwent brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) scanning of the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), followed by symptom, cognition, and hand-grip strength assessments. Results: Eleven participants completed the study. Creatine treatment increased creatine concentration in both the pgACC and DLPFC (p = 0.004 and 0.012, respectively), decreased fatigue and reaction time (RT) on congruent and incongruent trials of the Stroop test (p = 0.036 and 0.014, respectively), and increased hand-grip strength (p = 0.0004). There was a positive correlation between increases in pgACC creatine and changes in RT on Stroop congruent and incongruent trials (p = 0.048 and p = 0.022, respectively). Creatine was well tolerated, and none of the participants stopped treatment. Conclusion: Creatine supplementation over six weeks in ME/CFS patients increased brain creatine and improved fatigue and some aspects of cognition. Despite its methodological limitations, this study encourages placebo-controlled investigations of creatine treatment in ME/CFS.",

                "abstract": "Introduction Altered subjective visual sensitivity manifests as feelings of discomfort or overload elicited by intense and irritative visual stimuli. This can result in a host of visual aberrations including visual distortions, elementary visual hallucinations and visceral responses like dizziness and nausea, collectively referred to as “pattern glare.” Current knowledge of the underlying neural mechanisms has focused on overall excitability of the visual cortex, but the individual contribution of excitatory and inhibitory systems has not yet been quantified. Methods In this study, we focus on the role of glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as potential mediators of individual differences in subjective visual sensitivity, measured by a computerized Pattern Glare Test—a series of monochromatic square-wave gratings with three different spatial frequencies, while controlling for psychological variables related to sensory sensitivity with multiple questionnaires. Resting neurotransmitter concentrations in primary visual cortex (V1) and right anterior insula were studied in 160 healthy participants using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results Data showed significant differences in the perception of visual distortions (VD) and comfort scores between men and women, with women generally reporting more VD, and therefore the modulatory effect of sex was considered in a further examination. A general linear model analysis showed a negative effect of occipital glutamate on a number of reported visual distortions, but also a significant role of several background psychological traits. When assessing comfort scores in women, an important intervening variable was the menstrual cycle. Discussion Our findings do not support that baseline neurotransmitter levels have a significant role in overreactivity to aversive stimuli in neurotypical population. However, we demonstrated that biological sex can have a significant impact on subjective responses. Based on this additional finding, we suggest that future studies investigate aversive visual stimuli while examining the role of biological sex.",

                "abstract": "Myocardial necrosis following the successful reperfusion of a coronary artery occluded by thrombus in a patient presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) continues to be a serious problem, despite the multiple attempts to attenuate the necrosis with agents that have shown promise in pre-clinical investigations. Possible reasons include confounding clinical risk factors, the delayed application of protective agents, poorly designed pre-clinical investigations, the possible effects of routinely administered agents that might unknowingly already have protected the myocardium or that might have blocked protection, and the biological differences of the myocardium in humans and experimental animals. A better understanding of the pathobiology of myocardial infarction is needed to stem this reperfusion injury. P2Y12 receptor antagonists minimize platelet aggregation and are currently part of the standard treatment to prevent thrombus formation and propagation in STEMI protocols. Serendipitously, these P2Y12 antagonists also dramatically attenuate reperfusion injury in experimental animals and are presumed to provide a similar protection in STEMI patients. However, additional protective agents are needed to further diminish reperfusion injury. It is possible to achieve additive protection if the added intervention protects by a mechanism different from that of P2Y12 antagonists. Inflammation is now recognized to be a critical factor in the complex intracellular response to ischemia and reperfusion that leads to tissue necrosis. Interference with cardiomyocyte inflammasome assembly and activation has shown great promise in attenuating reperfusion injury in pre-clinical animal models. And the blockade of the executioner protease caspase-1, indeed, supplements the protection already seen after the administration of P2Y12 antagonists. Importantly, protective interventions must be applied in the first minutes of reperfusion, if protection is to be achieved.

                "abstract": "Background Ventricular septal rupture (VSR) is a serious complication occurring after myocardial infarction (MI). Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a common complication of VSR and an important factor affecting its prognosis. CS can occur in either an immediate or delayed manner after VSR; however, studies on the risk factors associated with immediate or delayed CS are scarce. Methods We retrospectively studied patients diagnosed with VSR after MI and admitted to the West China Hospital between September 2009 and August 2023. Demographic data, medical history, physical examination results, electrocardiograms, and echocardiographic and hematological data were extracted from electronic medical records or archived records. CS was defined as hypotension (<90 mmHg) and/or the requirement for catecholamines, pulmonary congestion, and signs of end-organ failure. The CS onset time was defined as the time at which catecholamines were initiated. Results A total of 88 patients with VSR after MI, including 49 males (55.7%), were enrolled. The average age was 70.2 years. Of these patients, 32 (36.4%) who already had CS at the time of VSR discovery were defined as immediate CS, and 28 (31.8%) who developed CS within 2 weeks after VSR discovery were defined as delayed CS. A smaller left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and VSR discovered after admission were independent risk factors for immediate CS. Elevated heart rate and higher levels of creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme on admission were independent risk factors for delayed CS in patients without immediate CS after VSR. Conclusions The occurrence of CS in patients with VSR after MI has an evident time course. Thus, an early identification of patients at risk of immediate or delayed CS and optimization of treatment procedures may help improve the prognosis.",

                "abstract": "Objective To investigate whether hs-CRP and IL-6 provide additional diagnostic value beyond that achieved by the HEART score in patients with chest pain suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) admitted to the emergency department (ED). Methods This was a post hoc analysis using data from the RACING-MI study. Baseline data, including hs-CRP and IL-6 levels, were analyzed using the plasma from the biobank. A total of 818 patients with chest pain suggestive of ACS were included in this analysis. Of these, 98 were diagnosed with ACS (12%). Logistic regression was used to identify the independent predictors of ACS development in patients with chest pain. Results hs-CRP levels >2 mg/L were observed in 50% of all ACS cases. IL-6 levels >1.3 pg/mL were observed in 71% of all ACS cases. hs-CRP had a sensitivity of 50% and specificity of 51% for the diagnosis of ACS, whereas IL-6 had a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 29%. The diagnostic likelihood ratios for ACS was 1.0 for hs-CRP>2 mg/L and IL-6 > 1.3 pg/mL, respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that age, male gender, and ongoing smoking were associated with ACS in patients with acute chest pain. No association was found between IL-6 or hs-CRP level and ACS. This was observed for both IL-6 and hs-CRP, whether assessed on a continuous scale or using prespecified cut-off values. Conclusion Among the 818 patients admitted to the ED with chest pain suggestive of ACS, neither hs-CRP nor IL-6 provided an independent added diagnostic value. Our results suggest that inflammatory markers have limited diagnostic value in detecting patients with ACS in the ED.",

Despite the growing recognition of TTS, acute complications and long-term mortality rates are comparable to those observed in AMI patients. In this context, a systematic diagnostic approach is imperative for an accurate patient assessment, with due consideration of the distinctive characteristics and optimal timing of each imaging modality. Coronary angiography with ventriculography may be reserved for cases presenting with ST-segment elevation, whereas in all other cases, the use of multimodality noninvasive imaging allows for a comprehensive evaluation of typical diagnostic features and detection of acute complications while also providing prognostic insights. The aim of this review is to evaluate the current research on non-invasive modalities and to propose a diagnostic algorithm that will facilitate the identification and management of TTS.",

Although women over 55 years make up the majority of TTS patients, male patients have a greater incidence of in-hospital mortality. TTS also impacts pregnant women and children, with conflicting information regarding racial differences. TTS has an in-hospital mortality rate comparable to that of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and higher than that in patients with myocarditis. More than 10% of patients may experience a subsequent acute episode within 5 years after the initial event. TTS exhibits symptoms such as chest pain, electrocardiograph (ECG) abnormalities, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) levels, and changes in several imaging approaches, which may aid in early diagnosis. Fluid resuscitation, β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), anti-anxiety or depression drugs, and cardiac rehabilitation may be employed to treat TTS, reduce recurrence rates, and improve functional exercise capacity and exercise time. After searching PubMed, Research Gate, Science Direct, and Web of Science, we summarized recent researches on epidemiology, diagnosis, treatments, and prognosis. These findings provide a theoretical basis for future clinical practice and will aid doctors and researchers investigating the unknown aspects of TTS.",

                "abstract": "Abstract Background Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is characterized by transient regional left ventricular (LV) dysfunction occurring in individuals exposed to physical or emotional stress. Various stressors are triggers for TTS in cancer patients, and anti-cancer drugs have recently been proposed as a trigger. Therefore, further studies are needed to clarify these triggers and avoid the unnecessary interruption of anti-cancer treatment. Case summary A 66-year-old woman presented with dyspnoea 10 days after the initiation of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab. She had previously received osimertinib as first-line therapy for recurrent lung cancer after primary resection and atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin as second-line therapy. She was admitted due to electrocardiography abnormalities and elevated troponin I and brain natriuretic peptide levels. Echocardiography revealed circumferential severe LV hypokinesis at the mid-ventricular level, with preserved wall motion at the base and apex. Cardiac catheterization performed after the attenuation of symptoms with 20 mg of intravenous furosemide showed normal coronary arteries. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging on Day 4 revealed increases in T1 and T2 values and extracellular volume fraction; however, neither myocardial infiltration of inflammatory cells or myocardial necrosis was observed in endomyocardial samples obtained on the day of her arrival. Atypical TTS was suspected, and she was treated with perindopril, bisoprolol, and spironolactone. Magnetic resonance imaging 1.5 months after the onset of TTS showed improvements in LV contractility, T1 and T2 values, and the extracellular volume fraction. Discussion A more detailed understanding of the relationship between anti-cancer drugs and TTS is crucial for preventing interruptions to anti-cancer therapy.",

                "abstract": "Mechanical biomarkers distinguish health conditions through quantitative mechanical measurements. The emergence and establishment of nanotechnology in the last decades have provided new tools to obtain mechanical biomarkers at the nanoscale. Mechanical measurements are reproducible, label‐free, start to be applied in vivo can be high throughput, and require small samples. Mechanical protocols in clinical practice at the macro scale like palpation or blood pressure measurement are routinely used by medical doctors. Nanotechnology brought mechanical sensing to the next scale, where cells, tissues, and proteins can be probed and linked to medical conditions. Mechanical changes in cells and tissues may be detected before other markers, such as protein expression, providing an important advantage as biomarkers. In the present review, we explore the biomarker's historical evolution, describe mechanical biomarkers on various diseases and novel discoveries in the nanomechanical field for their characterization. We conclude that mechanical biomarkers are establishing novel hallmarks in diseases, in several cases for early diagnostics of diseases and discovery of drug targets in the proteins involved in the mechanical changes, while advances in instrumentation are bringing commercial products into the clinical practice. Mechanical biomarkers along with clinical testing are establishing an important niche in the market, whose demand is increasing due to the expansion of personalized medicine and unmet needs in the clinics.",

                "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to assess the impact of single whole-body cryostimulation (WBC) preceding submaximal exercise on oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers in professional, male athletes. The subjects (n = 32, age 25.2 ± 37) were exposed to low temperatures (−130 °C) in a cryochamber and then participated in 40 min of exercise (85% HRmax). Two weeks afterwards, the control exercise (without WBC) was performed. Blood samples were taken before the start of the study, immediately after the WBC procedure, after exercise preceded by WBC (WBC exercise) and after exercise without WBC. It has been shown that catalase activity after WBC exercise is lower in comparison with activity after control exercise. The interleukin 1β (IL-1-1β) level was higher after control exercise than after WBC exercise, after the WBC procedure and before the start of the study (p < 0.01). The WBC procedure interleukin 6 (IL-6) level was compared with the baseline level (p < 0.01). The level of Il-6 was higher both after WBC exercise and after control exercise compared with the level recorded after the WBC procedure (p < 0.05). Several significant correlations between the studied parameters were shown. In conclusion, the changes in the cytokine concentration in the athletes’ blood confirm that body exposition to extremely low temperatures before exercise could regulate the inflammatory reaction course and secretion of cytokines during exercise. A single session of WBC in the case of well-trained, male athletes does not significantly affect the level of oxidative stress indicators.",

                "abstract": "A hallmark of impaired myocardial energetics in failing hearts is the downregulation of the creatine kinase (CK) system. In heart failure patients and animal models, myocardial phosphocreatine content and the flux of the CK reaction are negatively correlated with the outcome of heart failure. While decreased CK activity is highly reproducible in failing hearts, the underlying mechanisms remains elusive. Here, we report an inverse relationship between the activity and acetylation of CK muscle form (CKM) in human and mouse failing hearts. Hyperacetylation of recombinant CKM disrupted MM homodimer formation and reduced enzymatic activity, which could be reversed by sirtuin 2 treatment. Mass spectrometry analysis identified multiple lysine residues on the MM dimer interface, which were hyperacetylated in the failing hearts. Molecular modeling of CK MM homodimer suggested that hyperacetylation prevented dimer formation through interfering salt bridges within and between the 2 monomers. Deacetylation by sirtuin 2 reduced acetylation of the critical lysine residues, improved dimer formation, and restored CKM activity from failing heart tissue. These findings reveal a potentially novel mechanism in the regulation of CK activity and provide a potential target for improving high-energy phosphoryl transfer in heart failure.",

DXN and GE were loaded into CNPs and cytotoxicity of loaded and unloaded drugs against HepG2 cells was evaluated. HCC was induced in male albino mice by injection of diethylnitrosamine (DINA). Mice were divided into eight groups (n = 15): (1) normal control, (2) DINA, (3) CNPs, (4) free DXN, (5) CNPs DXN, (6) free GE, (7) CNPs GE, and (8) CNPs DXN + CNPs GE. Both GE and DXN loaded into CNPs showed a greater decline in cell viability of HepG2 cells than the unloaded forms. GE CNPs displayed pronounced anticancer activity In Vivo through apoptosis, greater down-regulation of multidrug resistance 1, enhancement of anti-oxidant activity and depletion of vascular endothelial growth factor content in liver tissues. GE CNPs in combination with DXN CNPs showed nearly normal hepatic lobule architecture and the greatest increase in apoptotic cell count. Co-treatment group had decreased cardiac malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-α and serum activity of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. Combination of GE CNPs and DXN CNPs might be a potentially effective therapeutic approach for HCC.",

Still, little is known about the pathogenesis of pruritus in BP or the factors that affect the clinical course of the disease. This study aimed to evaluate the factors influencing the clinical course of BP among older patients. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of medical records of 55 patients with BP hospitalized in the dermatology department in 2015–2021 was conducted. The study focused on preliminary diagnosis, medical history, clinical examination (characteristics and location of cutaneous changes), laboratory investigation, and direct and indirect immunofluorescence. Results: Analysis of laboratory results in combination with the clinical course of BP showed that red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit values were negatively associated with a risk of erosions and erythema, while MCHC values were positively correlated with a risk of associated pruritus. A correlation was found between neurological diseases and an increased risk of erosions. Conclusions: We have shown that age and neurological conditions, including stroke, affect the clinical course of BP. Further studies on a larger group of patients should be conducted to investigate the different factors affecting the clinical aspect of BP and to understand the relationship between them.",

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDrug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a major concern for oncology drugs in clinical practice and under development. Monitoring cancer patients for hepatotoxicity is challenging as these patients may have abnormal liver tests pre-treatment or on-study for many reasons including liver injury due to past oncology treatments, hepatic metastases, medical co-morbidities such as heart failure, and concomitant medications. At present, there are no regulatory guidelines or position papers that systematically address best practices pertaining to DILI detection, assessment and management in oncology patients.\n\n\nAIMS\nThe goals of this review are (1) to examine and interpret the available evidence and (2) to make recommendations for detection, monitoring, adjudication, and management of suspected hepatocellular DILI during oncology clinical trials.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis manuscript was developed by the IQ Consortium (International Consortium for Innovation and Quality in pharmaceutical development) DILI Initiative that consists of members from 17 pharmaceutical companies, in collaboration with academic and regulatory DILI experts. The manuscript is based on extensive literature review, expert interpretation of the literature, and several rounds of consensus discussions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThis review highlights recommendations for patient eligibility for clinical trials with or without primary/metastatic liver involvement, as well as changes in liver tests that should trigger increased monitoring and/or discontinuation of study drug. Guidance regarding causality assessment for suspected DILI events, rechallenge and dose-modification is provided.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis review brings together evidence-based recommendations and expert opinion to provide the first dedicated consensus for best practices in detection, assessment, and management of DILI in oncology clinical trials.",

We present a case of slowly progressive rhabdomyolysis following SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 28-year-old male who was monitored through serial serum creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobin levels. Despite prominent CK elevations, the patient did not develop AKI, probably due to disproportionately mild serum myoglobin elevation with distinctive cyclic spikes. This case underscores the informative value of frequent monitoring of both CK and myoglobin to assess muscle damage severity and AKI risk in rhabdomyolysis, particularly with viral infections like COVID-19 that can cause delayed-onset muscle injury.",

It has gained increasing attention, particularly during the COVID-19 epidemic. However, to date, no relevant bibliometric research on the association between ECMO and ARDS (ECMO-ARDS) has been reported. Our study aimed to summarize the knowledge structure and research focus of ECMO-ARDS through a bibliometric analysis. Method Publications related to ECMO-ARDS from 2000 to 2022 were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). Research data underwent bibliometric and visual analysis by using CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and one online analysis platform. By analyzing the countries, institutions, journals, authors, the geographic distribution of research contributions as well as the leading institutions and researchers in this field were identified. Additionally, prominent journals and highly cited publications were highlighted, indicating their influence and significance in the field.

Methods We retrospectively studied the consecutive case series of 30 patients with confirmed influenza A-induced severe pneumonia treated in the intensive care unit at Dazhou Central Hospital in Sichuan, China, from March 1 to April 30, 2023. Logistic regression was used to analyze the independent risk factors, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were applied to evaluate the predictive efficacy of associated risk factors for mortality. Results The mortality rate was 33.3% in this study. Independent risk factors for mortality of patients were acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (p = 0.044) and septic shock (p = 0.012). ROC statistics for ARDS and septic shock to predict mortality in patients with influenza A-induced severe pneumonia demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.800 (sensitivity 80.0%, specificity 80.0%) and 0.825 (sensitivity 70.0%, specificity 95.0%), respectively. Conclusion ARDS and septic shock were the independent risk factors for mortality in patients with influenza A-induced severe pneumonia following the end of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. But high level of next generation sequencing reads Aspergillus coinfection, and comorbidities did not increase death risk of the study population.",

                "abstract": "Objective The objective of this study was to explore the value of serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) in the early diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of pneumonia associated with the novel coronavirus infection. Methods A total of 101 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia were included in the study. According to the severity of the initial chest computed tomography (CT), the patients were divided into the ordinary pneumonia group and the severe pneumonia group and then divided into the remission group and the nonremission group according to the changes of the chest CT after medication treatment. The differences in general characteristics, underlying diseases, clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, and imaging examination outcomes between groups were observed retrospectively. To analyze the diagnostic performance of LDH, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Results Compared with ordinary pneumonia patients, patients in the severe group presented with significantly higher LDH, neutrophil count, high-sensitivity troponin T (HS-TnT), C-reactive protein (CRP), human serum amyloid A (SAA), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP), and D-dimer. Compared with remission patients, non-remission patients presented with significantly higher LDH, neutrophil count, HS-TnT, CRP, SAA, procalcitonin (PCT), creatine kinase–MB mass (CKMB_M), NTproBNP, and D-dimer. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found that LDH [odds ratio (OR), 1.015; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.006–1024; p = 0.001] and neutrophil count (OR, 1.352; 95% CI, 1.008–1.811; p = 0.044) were independently associated with exacerbation in COVID-19 patients. For ROC analysis, the AUC was 0.833 (95% CI, 0.729–0.936; p < 0.001) when we use the LDH value of 256.69 U/L to discriminate the ordinary pneumonia and severe pneumonia patients. The AUC was 0.759 (95% CI, 0.603–0.914; p = 0.008) and the sensitivity is 92.3% when we combined the LDH (cutoff value 258.46 U/L) and the neutrophil count (cutoff value 6.76 × 109/L) to discriminate remission and non-remission patients. Conclusion The level of LDH is associated with the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia and can be used as important indicators to evaluate the prognosis of patients.",
